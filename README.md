# Time-Clock

Simple utility to keep track of time working. Meant as a personal tool for work-from-home. WIP. Made custom to my own use, utilizing terminal aliases to call the functions
for ease and simplicity. Time willing, I may expand this to be a full cli tool that can more easily be downloaded and used by others without any special setup. This README will be
updated with relevant info if I do.
